### incidence_group_gen

Given a graph or incidence matrix that corresponds to a graph, determine the incidence group of the graph as either a permutation group or as a finitely presented group.

### confluent_rewriting_systems

Given a graph or incidence matrix that corresponds to a graph, compute the confluent rewriting system of that graph using the Knuth-Bendix algorithm.
